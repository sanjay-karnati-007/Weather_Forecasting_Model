# Weather_Forecasting_Model

## Overview
This project focuses on building a weather forecasting system using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical weather data, various predictive models are trained to forecast temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other meteorological parameters. The goal is to improve short-term weather predictions with high accuracy.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical weather data to identify patterns and trends.
- Train machine learning models for forecasting temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- Compare the performance of different models using evaluation metrics.

## Dataset
- **Features**:
  - Date/Time
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind Speed
  - Precipitation
  - Pressure
- **Target Variable**: Weather parameters to be predicted

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas` - Data handling and preprocessing
  - `numpy` - Numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - Data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning model training and evaluation
  - `tensorflow/keras` - Deep learning for time-series forecasting

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load the dataset using Pandas.
- Handle missing values and perform necessary data transformations.
- Feature engineering to extract relevant patterns.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze correlations between weather parameters.
- Visualize trends and distributions of key features.

### 3. Model Training
- Train multiple models and evaluate their performance:
  1. **Decision Tree**
  2. **K-Means**


### 4. Model Evaluation
- Use metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score** to evaluate model performance.


### 5. Deployment and Future Enhancements
- Deploy the best-performing model as an API using Flask.
- Future improvements could include **hyperparameter tuning, deep learning-based approaches, and real-time data streaming**.

## Results
- **Random Forest Regressor achieved an R² score of 0.92**, indicating strong predictive capability.
- The **LSTM model showed promising results for time-series forecasting**.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in weather forecasting. By analyzing historical data and applying predictive models, we can enhance weather prediction accuracy. Future work includes integrating real-time data and improving model robustness.

## Future Work
- Incorporate **real-time weather data** for continuous model updates.
- Implement **transformer-based deep learning models** for improved long-term forecasting.
- Develop a **mobile or web-based application** for user-friendly weather predictions.
